1.0  xxxx-xx-xx

	* Fixed an assertion when a file named /etc/init/.conf is created.
	  Discovered by Коренберг Марк (Bug: #720573)

	* utmp entries will be replaced with DEAD_PROCESS ones when a
	  pid supervised by Upstart terminates.  (Bug: #183729)

	* shutdown now correctly returns error code if it fails to shutdown
	  the system.

	* Included bash completion script in contrib directory.
          (Bug: #672067)

0.6.7  2010-12-14  "Return of the Mole"

	* A new "manual" stanza has been added to the configuration, this
	  removes any previously defined "start on" stanza for job so that
	  the job can only be started with initctl "start".  This allows
	  quick disabling of a job with:

		echo "manual" >> /etc/init/jobname.conf

	* Upstart now emits a "GoalChanged" D-Bus signal immediately after
	  changing the "goal" property of an instance, a "StateChanged"
	  signal after changing the "state" property, and a "Failed" signal
	  after marking an instance as failed.

	* Job objects now include "start_on", "stop_on" and "emits"
	  properties containing the appropriate information from the
	  configuration.

	* For developers, a "debug" stanza has been added; if present in a
	  job, the job will wait before the exec call and can be attached
	  to by gdb to examine Upstart's state.

	* Manpage fixes.  (Bugs: #677392, #686734)

0.6.6  2010-04-27  "No, she's dead, this is her son"

	* Upstart will automatically mount /proc and /sys on boot if they
	  have not already been mounted by the kernel or initramfs.
	  (Bug: #426263)

	* Fixed double-quoting issue with the --with-local-libnih configure
	  option.  (Bug: #530385)

	* libnih 1.0.2 is now required.

0.6.5  2010-02-04  "Our last, best hope for victory"

	* Since libnih has been separated out into its own project, Upstart
	  no longer includes its source and now uses the installed version by
	  default.

	* The external nih-dbus-tool means that cross-compilation is trivial,
	  the path to it may be overriden with NIH_DBUS_TOOL=... as an
	  argument to configure.  (Bug: #426740)

	* Developers may still build against a local libnih source tree by
	  passing --with-local-libnih=/path/to/libnih to configure.

	* There is a new initctl "reload" command, with matching
	  /sbin/reload symlink.  This sends the SIGHUP signal to the running
	  main process of the named job instance.

	* Event operator matches in jobs now support "!=" in addition to the
	  usual "=", e.g.:

		start on net-device-added INTERFACE!=eth*

	  (Bug: #513035)

	* Moved D-Bus system bus reconnection trigger from SIGHUP to SIGUSR1,
	  since SIGHUP is already used for a forced configuration reload and
	  causes Upstart to "forget" state.

	* Fixed bug where the default runlevel would be lost when an
	  /etc/inittab file exists without an initdefault line.  (Bug: #405847)

	* Fixed "Unhandled error" message from shutdown.  (Bug: #426332)

	* Fixed "Unhandled error" assertion crash from Upstart child
	  processes when failing to spawn a job.  (Bug: #451917)

	* No longer holds /dev/console open, so the SAK SysRq key will not
	  kill Upstart.  (Bug: #486005)

	* Restored sync() call before reboot().

	* Added missing OPTIONS section to init(8) manpage.  (Bug: #449883)

0.6.3  2009-08-02  "Our last, best hope for peace"

	* Fixed an assertion when a job's main process is terminated
	  while in the stopping state.  (Bug: #406408)

	* Fixed compilation on ia64.

	* nih-dbus-tool(1) manpage will not be installed, since the binary
	  is not.  (Bug: #403103)

0.6.2  2009-07-21  "Buggrit, millennium hand and shrimp"

	* Fixed an assertion when a job receives a stop event or the
	  stop command while still in the starting state.

	* Changed exec() trace handling to allow the main process to
	  exec another before fork()ing while still following (e.g.
	  main script exec'ing a daemon)

	* Restored missing chdir("/") call when catching crashes.

0.6.1  2009-07-16  "Born in the wagon of a travelling show"

	* D-Bus 1.2.16 is now required.

	* Updated ptrace() code to handle receiving the trapped stopped
	  child _before_ we receive the trapped fork() syscall, which
	  seems to be the most common way the race goes when running
	  as init.  This seems to make "expect fork/daemon" largely work.
	  (Bug: #264711)

	* runlevel will now output "unknown" and exit with an error when
	  called before the first telinit call.  (Bug: #400248)

	* runlevel will prefix error messages with the utmp filename being
	  used.  (Bug: #400241)

0.6.0  2009-07-09  "How appropriate, you fight like a cow"

	* The licence for Upstart has been changed back to version 2 of the
	  GNU GPL.

	* D-Bus 1.2.15 is now required, this is the current GIT HEAD
	  pending a 1.2.16 release.

	* Configuration paths have changed.  Global configuration now
	  resides in "/etc/init.conf" while jobs are now configured in
	  "/etc/init"

	* Job configuration filenames must now end in ".conf"

	* Default configuration files are now supplied in the "conf"
	  sub-directory of the source, and installed into "/etc/init".

	  These match the Debian/Ubuntu sysvinit configuration so may
	  require some tweaking for other distributions, but provide an
	  excellent base.

	  The old example-jobs tarballs are deprecated.

	* The D-Bus interface remains unstable, to reflect this the current
	  interface name has changed to "com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6" and the
	  name of the job and instance interfaces have changed to match.

	* The "EmitEvent" D-Bus method gains a wait argument, when given
	  as TRUE (the recommended setting) the method call will be blocked
	  until all effects of the event have finished.  When FALSE the
	  method call will return once the event has been queued.

	* The "Start", "Stop" and "Restart" D-Bus methods of jobs and
	  instances gain a similar wait argument.

	* The Upstart D-Bus object now has "version" and "log_priority"
	  properties.  The former is to obtain the version of the init daemon,
	  the latter allows you to obtain and change the logging priority.

	* Job D-Bus objects now have "name", "description", "author" and
	  "version" properties to obtain the job name and the contents of
	  the equivalent job file fields for the others.

	* Instance D-Bus objects now have "name", "goal", "state" and
	  "processes" properties to obtain the instance name, goal, state
	  and list of running processes and their pids respectively.

	* The default D-Bus security policy now permits use of the "Get"
	  methods by all users, including obtaining values of properties.

	* initctl has been rewritten with functionality more along the
	  lines of Upstart 0.3.x than before; since many distributions are
	  still shipping 0.3.x the summary of changes for the tool reflects
	  both changes from 0.3.x and 0.5.x

	* The global "-p"/"--pid" argument has been dropped, since
	  communication is over D-Bus.  New "--system" and "--dest" arguments
	  have been added to force communication over the system bus, and
	  specify the destination, instead of using the private socket (this
	  is the default when run as non-root to permit "list" and "status"
	  to work for ordinary users).

	* The "-i"/"--id" and "--show-ids" options to commands have been
	  dropped since jobs no longer have ids.

	* Since instances may now have names, these will be displayed in
	  brackets after the job name when one is present.  The output of
	  the goal and state are now expressed as "start/running" instead
	  of "(start) running" to disambiguate.

	* initctl "start" and "stop" now only output the final state of
	  the job, not intermediate states it passes through.  When called
	  with "--no-wait", the commands now output a status before
	  returning (which may not be the final status).

	* initctl "start", "stop" and "status" now only accept a single
	  job name.  Further arguments are taken as KEY=VALUE environment
	  variables to pass to the job, replacing the previous "-e" option.

	* There is a new initctl "restart" command, with matching
	  /sbin/restart symlink.  This is the atomic equivalent of calling
	  "stop" and "start" with the exception that a stopped job will
	  not be started again.

	* In keeping with the newer instance model, instance jobs are now
	  output on separate lines with their full names rather than
	  indented under a "master" instance.

	* initctl "status" will exit non-zero if the job name was not
	  found.  (Bug: #328323)

	* initctl "status" now outputs information for multi-instance
	  jobs.  (Bug: #331407)

	* initctl "list" no longer accepts a pattern, use grep.  Output
	  is no longer sorted.

	* initctl "emit" no longer outputs changes that occur as a result
	  of the event.

	* When initctl "emit" is called with "--no-wait", it will return
	  immediately.  (Bug: #324890)

	* initctl "emit" now only accepts a single event name.  Further
	  arguments are taken as KEY=VALUE environment for the event,
	  replacing the previous "-e" option.

	* initctl "jobs" and "events" have been dropped.

	* initctl "log-priority" may be called without arguments, in
	  which case it will output the current priority.  (Bug: #280529)

	* initctl "reload" has been renamed to "reload-configuration"
	  to avoid confusion with reloading a job's configuration.

	* initctl(8) man page updated.  (Bug: #285753)

	* runlevel no longer accepts the --set and --reboot arguments,
	  instead telinit and shutdown write these records into utmp and wtmp.

	* runlevel(7) man page added to describe the runlevel event, and
	  the implementation of runlevels and System V compatibility in
	  Upstart.  (Bug: #60429)

	* telinit will no longer silently ignore the "a", "b" or "c"
	  runlevels.

	* telinit now accepts the previously ignored "-e" argument, passing
	  the environment variables given along with the runlevel event.

	* telinit now officially accepts the "q"/"Q" and "u"/"U" arguments,
	  the former will reload the Upstart configuration while the latter
	  will re-execute Upstart.

	* telinit q will also attempt to reconnect to the D-Bus system bus
	  if the connection has not been made, or has been lost.
	  (Bug: #323022)

	* reboot no longer silently ignores the "-t" option.

	* reboot now silently ignores the "-n", "-i" and "-h" options; it
	  will no longer sync your disks, down your network interfaces or
	  spin down your hard drives.  This functionality is all handled
	  by the kernel on a modern system.  (Bug: #92685)

	* reboot now writes a "shutdown" record to /var/log/wtmp, this means
	  that the "-w" option is honoured with its original intent.  We
	  still silently ignore the "-d" option.

	* shutdown message generation fixed to be more easily translatable.
	  (Bug: #102565)

	* The TERM/KILL timeout, and other system timeouts, now use the
	  monotonic clock so are unaffected by system clock changes.
	  (Bug: #389588)

	* Respawn detection now uses the monotonic clock so is unaffected
	  by system clock changes.  (Bug: #389586)

	* Significant improvement in the amount of manual pages included
	  with Upstart and their content.  (Bug: #60429)

	* A manual page refering people from /etc/inittab to /etc/init
	  is also included.  (Bug: #72058)

0.5.3  2009-06-22  "Britain's Flag Carrier"

	* Fixed segfault when initctl status called with arguments.
	  (Bug: #388753)

	* Fixed segfault when initctl log-priority called with no argument.
	  (Bug: #280529)

	* Fixed shutdown to pass $INIT_HALT variable as last argument, not
	  as first.  (Bug: #303574)

	* Added temporary support for "telinit u" until we have true re-exec
	  support.  This will be replaced by an initctl command in future.
	  (Bug: #388742)

	* Corrected formatting of initctl(8) manpage.  (Bug: #388745)

0.5.2  2009-06-17  "Something, something, something, D-Bus"

	* The licence for Upstart has been updated to GNU GPL v3.

	* Overhaul of the automatically generated D-Bus bindings code,
	  fixing many issues with memory leaks, inconsistent return values
	  and loss of method returns after the method has taken place.

	* D-Bus 1.2.4 is now required, and must be patched to fix
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22316

	* D-Bus Job objects now have "name", "description", "author"
	  and "version" properties.

	* D-Bus Instance object now have "name", "goal" and "state"
	  properties.

	* initctl now obtains the name properties for display instead of
	  printing the mangled object path component.  (Bug: #299290)

	* D-Bus configuration updated now that the daemon is fixed to be
	  deny-by-default, and updated to avoid bare "send_interface"
	  stanzas.  (Bug: #323021)

	* Fixed assertion caused by the post-start or pre-stop scripts
          exiting after the main process of a respawning job had exited
          (Bug: #381048)

	* The /proc filesystem need not be mounted if the "oom_adj"
	  configuration stanza is not used.  (Bug: #259801)

	* Overly large values to configuration stanzas are now caught
	  and rejected.  (Bug: #340134)

	* The --enable-compiler-warnings configure option has been
	  extended to add -Wextra, but turns off a few of the more extreme
	  warnings

	* GNU C Library v2.4 (or backported inotify support) is required

	* pkg-config 0.22 is now required, it probably was anyway but we
	  now explicitly check for it.

	* Dependency on Python for the D-Bus binding tool has been dropped
	  and replaced with a dependency on expat 2.0.0

0.5.1  2009-01-29  "Unexpected item in bagging area"

	* Major rewrite of the memory allocator used by Upstart; the
	  old allocator had several limitations and a few issues.
	  I must stress that none of the issues were known to affect
	  Upstart itself, however it pays to be prudent.

	* An issue where an object in a linked list would be freed after
	  the linked list was freed was fixed.  Upstart had some twisty
	  code logic to work around it, which has now been dropped.

	* An issue where a string could fail to be appended in an OOM
	  situation was fixed; if Upstart is affected, this could cause
	  D-Bus Introspection data to be corrupted.

	* An issue where multiple socket watches being freed could lead
	  to bad memory access has been fixed; Upstart 0.5.0 included a
	  temporary fix for the D-Bus connection handling, this replaces
	  that with a proper fix that also corrects the same problem for
	  timers and other main loop watches that Upstart was not believed
	  to be affected by.

	* Compiler warnings when compiling the test suite with -O1 and
	  above have been fixed where found.

	* A race condition in the test cases for a process stopping with
	  SIGSTOP has been fixed, this could sometimes cause this test
	  to hang.

0.5.0  2008-08-12  "One of those deaf-mutes"

	* The relationship between job definitions and their running
          instances has been overhauled completely.  Jobs may have
          zero or more instances, each one uniquely identified by
          their instance name which is set by expanding the argument
          to the "instance" stanza against the instance's environment.

	  For example, a job with "instance $TTY" in its definition
	  will have new instances created when started with TTY=tty1
	  and TTY=tty2, but starting again with TTY=tty1 will fail if
	  that instance is already running.

	* The default job configuration remains to be a singleton,
          however this is now accomplished simply by having the
          default for the instance stanza set to a static string.

	* Job events now include the instance name in a new $INSTANCE
          variable, and will always have $UPSTART_INSTANCE set in the
          environment of their processes.

	* Jobs may export environment from themselves into the job
          events using the new "export" stanza.

	* Events no longer have both arguments and environment,
          instead the order the environment is specified in is
          remembered and is used when matching.

	* The "start on" and "stop on" stanzas may now only be
          specified once, multiple events should be joined with the
          new "or" operator.  A new "and" operator exists as well, and
          parentheses are permitted, allowing arbitrarily complicated
          expression matches.

	* All environment from the matched start events is placed in
          the job, with the list of matched events placed in the
          $UPSTART_EVENTS variable, replacing the previous singular
          $UPSTART_EVENT variable.

	* The matches for the "stop on" stanza may refer to variables
          from the job environment, which comes from the "start on"
          stanza.

	  For example:
	      start on started apache or started httpd
	      stop on stopping $JOB

	* Job environment from the start command or events is
          available to all scripts, including "pre-stop" and "post-stop".

	* Environment from the matched stop events is only available
          to the "pre-stop" script, with the list of matched events
          placed in the $UPSTART_STOP_EVENTS variable so that the list
          of events that started the job is still available.

	* Environment is no longer lost after a respawn.

	* Environment from the kernel or initramfs may be included in
          a job by use of the "env NAME" stanza without a value set.

	* The "started" event is no longer emitted if the pre-stop
          script restarts the job, since the "stopping" event was
          never emitted.

	* By default, jobs now have the most suitable settings for
	  a daemon process that would match what they would have had
	  by calling daemon(). In particular, this means that the
	  previous "service" stanza is now the default and tasks need
	  to specify a "task" stanza.  It also means that if the job
	  really wishes to be a session leader (e.g. getty), it must
	  specify the new "session leader" stanza.

	* Processes that fork once may be supervised with the new
          "expect fork" stanza, processes that fork twice (most
          daemons) may be supervised with the new "expect daemon"
          stanza and processes that do not fork may signal readiness
          by SIGSTOP with the new "expect stop" stanza.

	* The "pid file", "pid timeout" and "daemon" stanzas have been
          removed in favour of the new functionality.

	* "respawn" now works for tasks, this will repeat the task
          until it finishes with a zero exit status or any other
          specified by "normal exit".

	* "respawn limit" now only affects automatic respawns, not
          those done by command.

	* If the main process fails to start due to exec() error, or
          other process setup error, it will not be respawned.

	* "respawn limit" may be "unlimited".

	* The "stalled" event has been removed.

	* "logd" was not maintained, and did not function correctly,
          so has been removed from the source.  The "console logged"
          stanza has also been removed.

	* New "oom" stanza allows adjustment of the OOM killer
          priority of the process and may be "never" to inhibit it.

	* The configuration directory has now changed to
          /etc/init/jobs.d

	* Configuration is still reloaded with inotify, but may be
          forced by sending init a HUP signal or with "initctl reload".

	* Support for the STOP, CONT and TERM signals has been
          removed.

	* libupstart and the native IPC mechanism has been removed,
          communication is now via D-Bus which is a new dependency.

	* The dependency on D-Bus introduces build-dependencies on
          pkg-config and Python.

	* The minimal recommended kernel version is now 2.6.24

	* The compat directory has been removed, the utilities are now
          considered part of Upstart.

	* initctl jobs has been dropped.

	* initctl commands do not support --no-wait yet

	* initctl status with no arguments now shows all jobs.

	* initctl events no longer exists

0.3.10 2009-06-17  "Two minutes to Belgium"

	* Compilation fixes

	* Fixed assertion caused by the post-start or pre-stop scripts
	  exiting after the main process of a respawning job had exited
	  (Bug: #381048)

0.3.9  2007-10-11  "Highway to the Danger Zone"

	* Fixed crasher caused by starting a job with a no-arguments event.

	* Initialisation order changed so that the control socket is opened
	  and configuration parsed after inherited file descriptors are closed
	  and the console opened.  Otherwise if we inherit fewer than the
	  standard three file descriptors (e.g. from OpenVZ) we closed our
	  own control socket, etc.  (Bug: #87173)

	* Kill all processes in a supervised process's process group so that
	  we catch looping or sleeping processes that a shell is waiting
	  for.  (Bug: #121733)

	* Missing inotify support detected correctly and warning suppressed.

	* Stanza names in configuration may no longer be placed inside quotes.

	* Fix dangling halt and poweroff symlinks when Upstart compiled
	  without --enable-compat=sysv.  (Bug: #93356)

	* Fix that --with-included-gettext did not include libintl.a
	  as it should have.  (Bug: #117848)

	* Updated hacking requirements to Automake 1.10 and Gettext 0.16.1
	  since this version of Automake makes it easier for package
	  maintainers because it causes us to ship libtool.m4 ourselves.

0.3.8  2007-03-11  "I had a little drink about an hour ago"

	* Fix an assertion error that occurred whenever a stop event for an
	  instance job was emitted.

	* Correct a bug where calling "stop" from a job without arguments
	  would stop the running job, and attempt to block until it was
	  stopped.  This can obviously never happen since it won't stop until
	  stop unblocks.

	* Add "version" and "log-priority" commands to initctl.

0.3.7  2007-03-09  "Lines of communication"

	* The "normalexit" stanza has been changed to "normal exit".

	* The "respawn COMMAND" short-cut for specifying both "respawn" and
	  "exec" in the same stanza has been removed.  Jobs that previously
	  used syntax such as:

		respawn /sbin/getty 38400 tty1

	  Should be changed to use:

		exec /sbin/getty 38400 tty1
		respawn

	  While the shortcut saved a little typing, it caused confusion and
	  hid the fact that "exec" and "script" were both options for
	  respawning services.

	* The "on EVENT" stanza has been removed, change your jobs to use
	  the identical "start on EVENT" instead.  This is because the "on"
	  stanza may be useful for other things in future.

	* Stanzas in job definitions may no longer be surrounded by single
	  or double quotes, allowing them to be turned into ordinary
	  tokens by quoting them.

	* Configuration of running jobs is no longer immediately changed
	  when the definition is changed on disk; the job must be stopped
	  first.  If the job is an instance job, all instances must be
	  stopped before an instance of the changed job definition will be
	  started.

	  This ensures that the post-stop process run when the job is stopped
	  matches the pre-start process run when it was started, and for
	  instance jobs ensures that any locking between them is identical.

	  Jobs marked for deletion, or jobs that have not yet replaced
	  another, will not ordinarily show up in the output of initctl
	  "status" or "list" unless addressed by id.  They cannot be
	  started or stopped, even when addressed by id.

	* Job definitions may safely omit "exec"/"script"; the job will stay
	  in the running state with no process until it is stopped manually
	  or by an event.

	  This allows a service to define hardware configuration; for example
	  the mixer service could restore the ALSA mixer in its pre-start
	  script and save the mixer state in its stop script.  "start mixer"
	  would restore the state, "status mixer" would show it was running
	  and "stop mixer" would save the state again and presumably mute it.

	* Sending the SIGPWR signal to init will emit the power-status-changed
	  event.  A simple job can hook this event, check the /etc/powerstatus
	  file and take further action.

	* As well as their name, all jobs now also have a unique id exported
	  in the UPSTART_JOB_ID environment variable and viewable with initctl
	  by using the "--show-ids" option to "status" or "list".

	  The unique id is changed whenever the job is reloaded from disk, or
	  whenever a new instance is started.  "start" and "stop" now default
	  to UPSTART_JOB_ID if no arguments are given (falling back to
	  UPSTART_JOB if that is not present either).  This means they act on
	  the current instance of the job, rather than spawning a new instance
	  or stopping all instances.

	  "start", "status" and "stop" also accept a new "--by-id" option
	  which makes them expect job ids as arguments instead of job names.

	* The initctl "status" and "list" commands group instances of
	  instance jobs together in their output, rather than repeating them
	  without further clarification.  E.g.:

		foo (instance)
		    (start) starting
		    (start) running, process 1000
		    (stop) post-stop, process 1050

	  The "stop" command will stop all instances when given the name of
	  an instance job; individual instances can be stopped using "--by-id"
	  after obtaining the id from "status --show-ids".

	* Wildcard patterns of job names to be listed can be given as an
	  argument to the initctl "list" command.

	* Starting and stopping jobs with initctl will now block until the
	  job reaches its goal state, outputting all status changes and
	  process ids until the goal is reached and will also output an error
	  and exit with a non-zero status if the job fails.

	  Remember that jobs default to being tasks, so "start" will actually
	  block until the job finishes and returns back to "(stop) waiting".
	  Use the "service" or "respawn" stanza to turn them into services to
	  that they only block until the "(start) running" state is reached.

0.3.5  2007-02-10  "Wear flowers in your hair"

	* Serialisation of job state between upstart processes is disabled;
	  though upstart will still re-exec itself when sent the TERM
	  signal, the new copy will not have any of the state of the old.
	  This will be restored in a later release.

	* WARNING: if you have any job declared "console owner" which is
	  run by the "stalled" event, comment out the "start on" stanza
	  before sending the TERM signal -- otherwise the newly started
	  process will start that job, which will kill your running X
	  server.

	* logd and the "console logged" (default) option are currently
	  disabled, pending large-scale changes to the way that this
	  works.

	* Job scripts have been renamed; "start" to "pre-start" and
	  "stop" to "pre-stop".

	* A new "post-start" script has been added, it's run after the
	  main process has been started and the "started" event is not
	  emitted until it finished.

	* A new "pre-stop" script has also been added, it's run when a
	  request or event comes in to stop a job, before the "stopping"
	  event is emitted and before the job is killed.  If this restarts
	  the job, it will not be stopped.

	* Job processes now have an UPSTART_JOB environment variable
	  containing the name of the job.

	* initctl start, stop and status will default to using UPSTART_JOB
	  if no arguments are given.  Therefore you can just put "stop"
	  or "start" into a job script.

	* Where a job was started or stopped by an event, the processes
	  now have an UPSTART_EVENT environment variable containing the
	  name of the event.

	* Events may now have arguments and environment variables attached,
	  these can be specified with initctl, e.g.

	  # initctl emit network-interface-up eth0 -eADDR=00:11:22:33:44:55:66

	* These arguments can be matched in the job by placing them after
	  the event name for the "start on" or "stop on" stanzas:

	  start on network-interface-up eth*

	  Additional arguments in the event are assumed to match if not
	  specified in the job definition, and wildcards may be used within
	  the job definition as shown above.

	* The arguments are also passed to the script of any job started or
	  stopped by this event as positional arguments, and the environment
	  variables are placed into the environment of the job.

	* The set of events emitted due to a job state change have been
	  completely changed.  The new events are as follows:

	  started: this is emitted once the job is running and ready, and
	  receives the job name as an argument.

	  stopped: this is emitted once the job has been fully stopped.  As
	  well as the job name, if the job terminated normally it will have
	  the "ok" argument; otherwise it will have the "failed" argument
	  followed by the name of the script that failed ("running" for the
	  main job) and either an EXIT_STATUS or EXIT_SIGNAL environemtn
	  variable indicating why it failed.

	  starting: this is emitted before the job is started (before even
	  the pre-start script is run).  Arguments are as "started".  The
	  job will not be started until this event has finished.

	  stopping: this is emitted before the job is stopped (but after the
	  pre-stop script is run).  Arguments are as "stopped".  The job will
	  not be stopped until this event has finished.

	  These events can be usefully combined as follows.

	  If the "hal" job requires "dbus" to be running, and "hal" must be
	  stopped before "dbus" may stop:

	  start on started dbus
	  stop on stopping dbus

	  If the "tomcat" job believes that it must be running before "apache"
	  can run, and should not be stopped until "apache" has been stopped:

	  start on starting apache
	  stop on stopped apache

	* The event named for the job has been completely removed; thus
	  jobs and events no longer share a namespace.

	* Jobs have goals to reach; for a task (the default), the goal is
	  to go from stopped, to started and back to stopped again.  This
	  means that when used for the "starting" or "stopping" event, the
	  entire task has to complete before the referenced job can actually
	  be started or stopped.

	  Services will normally only want the goal to be to go from stopped
	  to started; thus when used in "starting" in the example above, the
	  referenced job can be started once the service has been started
	  (and not stopped again).  A service is defined by specifying either
	  "respawn" or "service" in the definition.

	* The list of exit codes that determine whether the main process
	  failed or succeeded can be specified by the "normalexit"
	  configuration stanza.  The arguments to this stanza can be exit
	  codes or signal names, e.g.

	  normalexit 1 99 100 INT QUIT

	  Zero is implied in the list, unless the job is marked "respawn"
	  since for those jobs, this is the list of exit codes and signals
	  that cause the job to be not respawned.

	* There is no longer a respawning state, or "respawn script".  Jobs
	  will instead be stopped and started through the same scripts.

	* Jobs marked with the "instance" stanza can be started multiple
	  times; each time they are started, a new instance is created.

	* If any job whose goal is changed by an event fail to reach their
	  new goal, a further "EVENT-NAME/failed" event will be emitted once
	  the event has finished being handled.

	  This can be used to emit, for example, a "path-unmounting" event
	  and to not proceed to "path-unmounted" unless it succeeds.

	* initctl emit will block until the event has been handled; it will
	  also output job status information for any job changed by the event
	  and terminate with an exit status of 1 if any of those jobs failed
	  to reach their new goal.

	* The set of events emitted by the "telinit" compatibility command
	  have been changed.  It now only emits a single "runlevel" event,
	  and supplies the new runlevel as an argument to it.

	  You should change job files that use:

	      start on runlevel-2

	  to use the following:

	      start on runlevel 2

	  This means also that "stop on runlevel" would stop the job on
	  any runlevel change.

	* Neither the "telinit" nor "shutdown" commands now emit a
	  "shutdown" event, in fact, this event has been removed altogether.
	  "shutdown" now simply emits the appropriate runlevel event;
	  the -H and -P arguments set the INIT_HALT variable in the
	  environment of that event, just as it does in sysvinit.

	* Normal output from initctl, etc. is no longer prefixed "initctl:"

	* The "ctrlaltdel" event has been renamed to "control-alt-delete".

0.3.2  2007-02-06  "Could anybody have tampered with your luggage?"

	* Fix leak of inotify file descriptor that could allow any process
	  on the system to remove upstart's watch on its configuration
	  directory.

	* New "emits" configuration stanza, used to list events that are
	  emitted by the job itself.  Intended for use by front-ends to
	  draw event graphs and the like.

	* Dropped "depends" configuration stanza and all related code.
	  This will be replaced by the complex state mechanism.

	* Rewritten IPC code to be significantly simpler, with the goal of
	  having a stable interface once we hit the end of this milestone
	  series.

	* Rewritten configuration parser and inotify watch infrastructure
	  to be more maintainable in future.

	* Now supports systems where inotify is disabled.

	* Duplicate configuration stanzas are no longer permitted.

	* Bug fixes, especially concerning malloc failure.

0.3.1  2006-12-13  "The Gathering"

	* Compilation fixes

	* Bug fixes.

	* Massive improvement to test framework, which should make it much
	  easier to test new features.

0.3.0  2006-10-17

	* Reverted logd behaviour from previous version, it's up to the
	  init scripts to send messages to the console if they wish.

	* Compatibility programs must now be explicitly enabled by using
	  ./configure --enable-compat=sysv

	* "shutdown" and "reboot" are now considered System V compatibility
	  programs, as they emulate the behaviour of those.  Dropped some
	  added options to make them fit.

	* All programs given improved --help text.

	* "initctl" rewritten, any sub-command can be run directly by
	  making it a symlink to "initctl" itself.

	* "start", "stop" and "status" are now just symlinks to "initctl";
	  not a separate binary.

0.2.7  2006-09-20

	* logd writes received messages to the console unless "quiet" is
	  on the kernel command-line

	* runaway jobs are now caught when they start, rather than respawn,
	  so stop/start loops are caught

	* Include inotify support for compiling under glibc 2.3

0.2.6  2006-09-13

	* Fix major bug on architectures with 64-bit kernel and 32-bit
	  user-land caused by an inconsitency between the behaviour of
	  kernel's compat_sys_waitid() vs. sys_waitid() functions.

	* "halt" now only calls "shutdown -h now"

0.2.5  2006-09-09

	* "control-alt-delete" event name changed to "ctrlaltdel".

	* "initctl shutdown EVENT" added that performs the same job as
	  "shutdown" but without all the usual warnings, timings, etc.

	* "logd" has now been written, if installed this is started by init
	  before sending the "startup" call and all jobs with "console logged"
	  (the default) will have their output sent to this daemon.  It
	  currently just logs to /var/log/boot.

	* "shutdown -k" implemented.

	* The "shutdown" utility has been changed to generate "system-halt"
	  for "-H", "power-off" for "-P" and just "halt" if only "-h" given.

	* If "shutdown" is run when running under sysvinit, it will now
	  send the appropriate /dev/initctl message to allow upgrades.

	* "telinit S" implemented.

	* Instead of trying to start or stop jobs, "telinit" now just sends
	  "runlevel-X" events.

	* The "telinit" utility now ensures a "shutdown" event is sent
	  before switching to runlevel 0, 1 or 6.

	* If "telinit" is installed and init is called by the super-user,
	  "telinit" is invoked instead.

	* Basic manual pages included.

0.2.1  2006-09-01

	* Compilation fixes

0.2.0  2006-09-01

	* "shutdown", "reboot", "halt" and "poweroff" utilities provided
	  that match their traditional equivalents.

	* "start", "stop" and "status" utilities provided to start, stop
	  and query the status of jobs respectively.

	* "runlevel" and "telinit" utilities provided for compatibility.

	* "initctl list" will list active jobs.

	* Events vastly simplified to just simple strings.

	* Jobs now generate "jobname/start", "jobname/started",
	  "jobname/stop" and "jobname/stopped" events as they go through
	  state transitions.

	* Services generate a "jobname" event when they are running.

	* Tasks generate a "jobname" event when they have finished.

	* The "shutdown" utility will generate a "shutdown" event followed
	  by one of "maintenance", "reboot", "halt" or "poweroff" or any
	  admin-specified event.

	* "stalled" event generated when no jobs are running or queued.

	* "control-alt-delete" event generated when that key combination
	  is pressed

	* "kbdrequest" event generated when Alt-UpArrow is pressed

	* Runaway respawning services will now be caught.

	* init will re-exec on receipt of the SIGUSR1 signal.
