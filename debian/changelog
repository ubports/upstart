upstart (1.10-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - fixes racy test utmp test case.  Closes: #722572.
    - drop changes to init/job_class.[ch] process priority handling in favor
      of upstream version.
  * Pull in Ubuntu packaging changes:
    - add INIT_VERBOSE to rc*.conf, overlooked in the previous merge.
    - call dh-autoreconf, adding build-depends on dh-autoreconf and autopoint.
    - update debian/copyright.
    - add upstart-monitor package.
    - migrate to python3.
    - use "serial-tests" harness during build, instead of automake1.13's
      default "parallel-tests" harness; and build-depend on automake
      (>= 1.12) for this interface.
    - Enable parallel build.
    - Enable initial autopkgtests, just doing a package build and rerunning
      the test suite.
    - Add upstart-dconf-bridge package.
    - Silence running-in-container when called from apparmor-profile-load.

upstart (1.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Declare a Breaks: against old versions of cryptsetup which have upstart
    jobs named in a way that will deadlock the boot.  (Ref: bug #694499)
  * Make versioned build-dep on json-c (>= 0.10) explicit.
  * Add debian/conf/dbus-reconnect.conf, to tell upstart to connect to the
    system bus once dbus is started.  This is a temporary solution until
    dbus in Debian has native upstart support.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Dec 2012 00:28:29 -0800

upstart (1.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * init/tests/test_job_process.c: don't test the blocked/ignored signal list
    in a spawned job; this is not testing the upstart code but the
    characteristics of the system, and the test is wrong because it assumes
    the signal lists in /proc/self/status fit in an unsigned long int
    - patently untrue on mips, where we have 128 signals for historical
    reasons.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Nov 2012 12:25:21 -0600

upstart (1.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * init/tests/test_job_process.c: cherry-pick upstream fix for test which
    was accidentally relying on a variable persisting after it's gone out of
    scope.
  * init/tests/test_job_process.c: drop change to print path in the test,     
    should be fixed by the above.
  * init/job_class.[ch]: instead of assuming a fixed value (0) as the
    default nice value for job processes, use whatever the nice value of the
    current process is.  This will be important later for user sessions
    where an entire session may be started with a higher nice value; and it
    fixes running the test suite as part of a nice'd build.
  * init/tests/test_job_class.c: update test suite to match.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Nov 2012 01:54:29 -0600

upstart (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Add build-dependency on libjson0-dev.
  * Export $TERM in init/Makefile.am; the Debian buildds don't set this,
    which results in test failures because of assumptions that it will be
    available.
  * init/tests/test_job_process.c: tests are failing to re-exec the test
    binary on mips for no clear reason; output the path so we can try to
    debug.
  * init/tests/test_job_process.c: amd64 build failed with an inscrutible
    error from waitid().  Print errno on failure to try to diagnose this. 

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Nov 2012 23:19:37 -0600

upstart (1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.
  * New upstream release.  Closes: #627544.
  * Drop /etc/init/dbus-reconnect.conf, no longer needed.
  * Add new jobs from Ubuntu: console, container-detect, failsafe,
    flush-early-job-log, rcS.conf, shutdown, wait-for-state.
  * Use 'linux-any' in the architecture check in debian/control, instead of
    trying to enumerate all non-linux archs.  Closes: #634513.
  * Conflict with lxcguest package (Ubuntu-specific).
  * Breaks old friendly-recovery (Ubuntu-specific).
  * Mark upstart multi-arch: foreign.
  * Add upstart-events(7) manpage from Ubuntu.
  * Update packaging to dh(1), debian/compat=9 (from Ubuntu).
  * debian/running-in-container: a script using container.conf to
    answer whether upstart is running in a container.
  * refresh soon-to-be-obsolete upstart-job helper from Ubuntu.
  * Add bash-completion support.
  * Add /var/log/upstart directory and logrotate support.
  * Don't re-exec init on upgrade, we don't currently support stateful
    re-exec.
  * Switch to source format 1.0 for consistency with Ubuntu and for sane(r)
    VCS handling.
  * Add versioned dependencies on ifupdown and udev for the prerequisite
    boot events.
  * util/shutdown.c: look for sysvinit at /run/initctl before /dev/initctl,
    so that we're compatible with both the old and new paths used by
    sysvinit in Debian.  Closes: #659540.
  * Move to bzr for the official package Vcs, for greater synergy with the
    Ubuntu packaging.
  * Use copyright-format/1.0 for debian/copyright.  This drops Scott from
    the list of copyright holders, as an individual copyright is not
    attested in any of the upstream sources.

upstart (1.5-0ubuntu9) quantal-proposed; urgency=low

  * debian/apparmor-profile-load: exit 0 if apparmor_parser fails to not
    block upgrades (errors will still be logged by upstart). This can be
    removed once apparmor_parser better deals with new policy on old kernels
    - LP: #1058356

 -- Jamie Strandboge <jamie@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 12 Oct 2012 13:54:10 -0500

upstart (1.5-0ubuntu8) quantal; urgency=low

  * Merge of latest upstream including doc fixes, fixes for booting

  * New maintainer. Closes: #624440.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Thu, 28 Apr 2011 14:33:39 -0700

upstart (0.6.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Mount /proc and /sys on initialisation. Closes: #577710
    - Since version 0.6.5 upstart no longer includes a internal copy of libnih
      but instead depends on it being installed system wide.
    - Provide a separate function to reconnect to the D-Bus system bus which
      can be triggered by the SIGUSR1 signal as a config reload has the
      negative side effect of losing state.
  * debian/control
    - Add Build-Depends on libnih-dev (>= 1.0.2), libnih-dbus-dev (>= 1.0.2)
      and nih-dbus-tool.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4. No further changes.
    - Add ${misc:Depends}.
  * debian/conf/dbus-reconnect.conf
    - Use SIGUSR1 to tell upstart to reconnect to the D-Bus system bus.
  * debian/upstart.docs
    - Remove ChangeLog.nih which is no longer included in the source.
  * debian/conf/tty*.conf
    - Run getty in 8-bit clean mode to better handle UTF-8 environments.
  * Switch to source format 3.0 (quilt).
    - Drop Build-Depends on quilt.
    - Remove quilt.make include and patch/unpatch targets from debian/rules.
    - Add debian/source/format.
  * Add SELinux support. Closes: #543420
    - Add debian/patches/01-selinux.patch to make upstart load the policy if
      SELinux is enabled. Patch by Russell Coker with some minor changes and
      build system integration.
    - Add debian/patches/99-autoreconf.patch.
    - Add Build-Depends on libselinux-dev.

 -- Michael Biebl <biebl@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Jun 2010 21:15:12 +0200

upstart (0.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/patches/10-ptrace_include_cleanup.patch
    - Removed, merged upstream.

 -- Michael Biebl <biebl@debian.org>  Wed, 05 Aug 2009 02:38:44 +0200

upstart (0.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/10-ptrace_include_cleanup.patch
    - Cleanup header includes. Only include ptrace.h in files that actually
      need it. This also fixes a build failure on ia64.
  * debian/rules
    - Run dh_install with --list-missing.

 -- Michael Biebl <biebl@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Jul 2009 15:50:20 +0200

upstart (0.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New major upstream release. Closes: #530348
  * Remove patches that have been merged upstream or are obsolete
    - debian/patches/01-limits.patch
    - debian/patches/02-telinit-u.patch
    - debian/patches/03-static-convenience-libs.patch
  * Add Build-Depends on pkg-config (>= 0.22), libdbus-1-dev (>= 1.2.16) and
    libexpat1-dev (>= 2.0.0). D-Bus has replaced the home-grown IPC.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.2. No further changes.
  * debian/copyright
    - Update copyright years.
    - Clarify license text, Upstart is GPL-2 only.
    - Refer to the versioned GPL-2 document.
  * Drop upstart-logd package. The logd daemon has been buggy for quite a
    while and thus removed completely upstream.
  * debian/upstart.postinst
    - Use "telinit u" to tell init to re-exec itself.
  * debian/rules
    - Remove obsolete configure flag.
    - Use dh_install instead of copying the job files around manually.
  * Merge the upstart-compat-sysv, startup-tasks and system-services package
    into a single upstart package to avoid any unnecessary diversion between
    the Debian and Ubuntu packaging.
  * The location of the job files has changed from /etc/event.d to /etc/init,
    in addition a *.conf suffix is now mandatory.
  * Install rc.conf, rc-sysinit.conf, rcS.conf and control-alt-delete.conf as
    provided by upstream.
  * debian/conf/*.conf
    - Update tty job files for the new job syntax. Add a description and
      author field.
    - Add dbus-reconnect.conf which tells Upstart to reconnect to the D-Bus
      system bus when runlevel 2345 has been reached.
  * Update debian/upstart.install to reflect the changes above.
  * Drop debian/upstart.dirs, obsolete.
  * debian/README.Debian
    - Sync relevant changes from the latest Ubuntu package.
    - Remove outdated information.
  * Add initial support for upstart-job.
    upstart-job is both a virtual package and also small helper utility which
    allows to execute native upstart jobs while preserving the legacy sysv
    "/etc/init.d/<service> <action>" interface.

    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1. No further changes.
    - Update Vcs-* fields. Package is now managed with Git on git.debian.org.
    - Bump Build-Depends on debhelper to (>= 7).
  * debian/compat
    - Bump debhelper compat level to 7.
  * debian/rules
    - Use dh_prep instead of dh_clean -k.
    - Depend on $(QUILT_STAMPFN) instead of patch; patch is a phony target and
      thus always out of date.
    - Move $(QUILT_STAMPFN) dependency to config.status to avoid potential
      issues with parallel make.
  * debian/upstart-compat-sysv.preinst
    - Remove obsolete conffiles also on (re)install.
  * debian/patches/01-limits.patch
    - Include limits.h to fix build failures with current glibc.
      Patch taken from Ubuntu.
  * debian/patches/02-telinit-u.patch
    - Implement "telinit u" by sending Upstart SIGTERM.
      Patch taken from Ubuntu.
  * debian/patches/03-static-convenience-libs.patch
    - Build libnih and libupstart as static convenience libraries.
      Patch taken from Ubuntu.
  * Use set -e instead of #!/bin/sh -e for all maintainer scripts.

upstart (0.2.1-6) edgy; urgency=low

  * Make packages Essential, and change Depends to Pre-Depends so that the

  * Sync priority in debian/control with that in the archive (required)
  * Drop warning of dire consequences if you install upstart, seeing as it's
    installed by default.

    the /etc/event.d files themselves (other than the main ones).
  * Move tty definitions into system-services.
  * Modify tty definitions to start when the rcS task has finished.  This
    puts them in the "right" place when compared to gdm.  Ubuntu: #58630.

  * Correct rcS compatibility script to ignore any information in utmp so
    that all scripts are always run.  Ubuntu: #59203.
